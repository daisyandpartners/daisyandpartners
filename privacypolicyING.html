        <h3>Type of cookies</h3>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.daisyandpartners.com">www.daisyandpartners.com</a> website uses cookies to make the user's browsing experience easier and more intuitive: cookies are small text strings used to store certain information that may relate to the user, his or her preferences or internet access device (computer, tablet or mobile phone) and are mainly used to adapt the operation of the site to the user's expectations, offering a more personalised browsing experience and storing the choices made previously.</p>
        <p>A cookie consists of a small set of data transferred to the user's browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that performed the transfer. It is not executable code and does not transmit viruses.</p>
        <p>Cookies do not record any personal information and any identifiable data will not be stored. If you wish, you can prevent the saving of some or all cookies. However, in this case your use of the website and the services offered may be impaired. To proceed without changing your cookie options, simply continue browsing.</p>
        <p>Below are the types of cookies the site uses: Technical cookies, Third-party cookies, Profiling cookies.</p>
        
        <h3>Technical cookies</h3>

They are necessary for the transmission of communications on the electronic network or for the supplier to provide the service requested by the customer.</p>
        <p>The settings for managing or deactivating COOKIES may vary depending on the Internet browser used.

        <p>From the point of view of duration, a distinction can be made between temporary session cookies, which are automatically deleted at the end of the browsing session and serve to identify the user and thus avoid logging in each time a page is visited, and permanent cookies, which remain active on the computer until they expire or are deleted by the user.</p>
